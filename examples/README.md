                            <li> model training (fine tuning a pre-trained model) </li>
                            <li> logging of model,summary, parameters and extra files at the end of training    
                            <li> deployment of the  model in TorchServe </li>

2.`E2EBert` - Demonstrates a workflow using a pytorch-lightning based BERT model.  
                           The example illustrates,  
                           <li> model training (fine tuning a pre-trained model)  
                           <li> model saving and loading using mlflow autolog  
                           <li> deployment of the  model in TorchServe  
                           <li> Calculating explanations using captum  

3.`IrisClassification` -  Demonstrates distributed training (DDP) and deployment using Iris Dataset and MLflow-torchserve plugin. This example illustrates the use of model signature.

This folder contains there different examples as shown below

1. `BertNewClassification` -Demonstrates an End to End deep learning workflow using a pytorch based BERT model.
                           The example illustrates,
                           a.) model training (fine tuning a pre-trained model), 
                           b.)logging of model,summary, parameters and extra files at the end of training
                           c.)model registration in mlflow model repository
                           d.)deployment of the registered model in TorchServe
                        
2. `IrisClassification` -  Demonstrates model training and deployment using Iris Dataset and MLflow-torchserve plugin with `MLflow cli` commands.

3. `Iris_TorchScript` -   Demonstrates saving TorchScript version of the Iris Classification model and deployment of the same using MLflow-torchserve plugin with `MLflow cli` commands
4. `MNIST` - Demonstrates training of MNIST handwritten digit recognition and deployment of the model using MLflow-torchserve **python plugin**
5. `TextClassification` - Demonstrates training of TextClassification example
                          and deployment of the model using using MLflow-torchserve **python plugin**
